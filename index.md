Hello, my name is Tim Allen Hermosisima Lacaba.

I am a Computer Science major at UCSD, and an aspiring Software Engineer.

My dream is to work as a game developer, whatever form that may take; whether I work at a dream studio like Obsidian Entertainment, or at a smaller developer company like Re-logic.

My hobbies consist of:
* Playing video games (which is actually what got me into computer science in the first place). My top three favorite games would have to be:
  1. Fallout: New Vegas
  2. Terraria
  3. Destiny
* Going camping (mostly with family and friends, but I'd love to start going solo camping!)
* Bowling (there aren't many bowling alleys near UCSD so my brothers have been practicing more and have gotten _a lot_ better than me, but that won't stop me competing!)

## Goals in life

- [x] Transfer from community college to UCSD
- [ ] Ace CSE 110
- [ ] Finish up independent projects
- [ ] Acquire an internship
- [ ] Secure a job after graduating
- [ ] Graduate from UCSD

## Lessons Learned in CSE 110

An interesting lesson that I have already learned in my CSE 110 course was that there is a large distinction between software _development_ and software _engineering_. An [article (external link)](https://www.mtu.edu/cs/undergraduate/software/what/) posted by Michigan State states:

> **Software engineering** is the branch of computer science that deals with the **design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications**. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.

## Objectives for CSE 110

One thing that I hope to gain more experience in is using git in group environments. From CSE 15L, I learned the basics, like how to use commands like:

```
git clone
git commit
git push
```

But I never really learned how to utilize git in a workflow that consists of mutiple developers.
